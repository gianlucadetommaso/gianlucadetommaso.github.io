Hello, visitor! My name is Gianluca. I have a PhD in Mathematics with a focus on Statistics and Machine Learning. I worked at Amazon and AWS for 4+ years, and I am currently leading the efforts on AI Assurance across [Helsing](https://helsing.ai/).

During my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, practising one-arm handstand ([this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xrU1Yw6uc) is unbelieavable) and steel mace flow (what's that, you ask? [Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOp5TdUaUf0)), making Napolitean pizza (try [this](https://youtu.be/zSfYQcGLFTY?t=140) recipe!), or thinking about math questions (my favourite current topic? Check [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09762) out).

Please you this website if you want to stalk my past experiences, or to learn something new around my research interests!
